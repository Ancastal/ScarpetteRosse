# ScarpetteRosse

ScarpetteRosse is an iOS application that was developed as a team project during the Apple Foundation Program in 2021. The primary goal of the app is to raise awareness on the critical issue of domestic violence. ScarpetteRosse comprises a user-friendly interface that features a psychological test designed to assist users in recognizing the risks of their relationship. The test is based on the expert advice of several organizations working for victims of domestic violence, aiming to identify the features of potentially dangerous and toxic relationships.

Upon completion of the test, the user is presented with a result and various options if their relationship is determined to be at risk. With the help of a geolocated map, the user can locate specialized agencies near their location in Italy, enabling them to connect with these resources in a safe and straightforward manner.

To further enhance user safety, ScarpetteRosse offers a login form with FaceID support and the ability to change the app icon to fake icons that are unrelated to the topics of the app. These features are designed to add an additional layer of privacy by making it difficult for others to identify the app on a user's device.

Future developments for ScarpetteRosse include the creation of a real-time chat system with experts from the specialized agencies.
